    const qualityTier = determineQualityTier(positionComplexity);
    
    return {
        success: true,
        primary_recommendation: {
            move: availableMoves[0],
            quality_tier: qualityTier,
            quality_score: calculateRealisticScore(positionComplexity),
            // ... comprehensive scoring and educational content
        },
