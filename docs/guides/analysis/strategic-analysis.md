# Strategic Analysis Guide

## Overview

Strategic analysis provides advanced decision-making tools for competitive Azul play. This guide covers strategic position evaluation, long-term planning, and complex tactical scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Basic Analysis**: Familiarity with pattern detection and scoring optimization
- **Game Understanding**: Solid understanding of Azul mechanics and scoring
- **Strategic Thinking**: Ability to think multiple moves ahead

### Accessing Strategic Analysis

1. **Navigate to Analysis**: Click "üîç Analysis" in the main navigation
2. **Strategic Analysis Tab**: Select the "Strategic Analysis" tab
3. **Position Setup**: Set up the position you want to analyze

## Strategic Analysis Features

### Position Evaluation

#### Overall Position Strength

Strategic analysis evaluates positions based on:

- **Wall Completion Potential**: How close you are to completing rows, columns, and color sets
- **Pattern Line Efficiency**: How well your pattern lines are set up
- **Floor Line Management**: Strategic floor line usage and penalty minimization
- **Factory Control**: Your ability to control tile availability
- **Endgame Preparation**: How well positioned you are for endgame scoring

#### Strategic Scoring

The system provides strategic scores for:

- **Immediate Opportunities**: Current tactical opportunities
- **Medium-term Planning**: 2-3 move planning scenarios
- **Long-term Strategy**: Endgame preparation and positioning

### Strategic Planning

#### Multi-move Planning

Strategic analysis can plan multiple moves ahead:

1. **Current Position**: Analyze the current game state
2. **Move Generation**: Generate possible moves for the next 2-3 turns
3. **Position Evaluation**: Evaluate resulting positions
4. **Recommendation**: Suggest the best strategic path

#### Risk Assessment

The system evaluates strategic risks:

- **Floor Line Risk**: Probability of floor line penalties
- **Blocking Risk**: Risk of being blocked by opponents
- **Scoring Risk**: Risk of missing scoring opportunities
- **Endgame Risk**: Risk of poor endgame positioning

### Advanced Features

#### Factory Control Analysis

Strategic analysis evaluates factory control:

- **Tile Availability**: Which tiles are available in factories
- **Opponent Needs**: What tiles opponents likely need
- **Blocking Opportunities**: Strategic blocking through factory control
- **Scoring Opportunities**: High-value tile combinations available

#### Endgame Preparation

The system helps prepare for endgame:

- **Wall Completion**: Planning for wall completion bonuses
- **Color Set Completion**: Maximizing color set bonuses
- **Floor Line Clearing**: Strategic floor line management
- **Multiplier Setup**: Setting up multiple bonus combinations

## Using Strategic Analysis

### Basic Workflow

1. **Set Up Position**: Use the position editor to set up your game state
2. **Run Analysis**: Click "Analyze Strategy" to start analysis
3. **Review Results**: Examine strategic recommendations
4. **Plan Moves**: Use recommendations to plan your next moves

### Advanced Workflow

1. **Deep Analysis**: Use "Deep Analysis" for comprehensive evaluation
2. **Scenario Planning**: Test different move sequences
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks of different strategies
4. **Move Planning**: Plan 2-3 moves ahead

## Interpreting Results

### Strategic Scores

#### Position Strength (0-100)

- **90-100**: Excellent position with clear advantages
- **70-89**: Strong position with good opportunities
- **50-69**: Balanced position with some opportunities
- **30-49**: Challenging position requiring careful play
- **0-29**: Difficult position requiring defensive play

#### Risk Levels

- **Low Risk**: Safe strategic options available
- **Medium Risk**: Some risk but manageable
- **High Risk**: Significant risk requiring careful consideration
- **Critical Risk**: High risk requiring immediate attention

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Move Priorities

1. **Critical**: Must-do moves for survival or major advantage
2. **High Priority**: Important moves for strategic advantage
3. **Medium Priority**: Good moves that improve position
4. **Low Priority**: Moves that maintain position without major gains

#### Strategic Themes

- **Aggressive**: Focus on scoring and wall completion
- **Defensive**: Focus on avoiding penalties and blocking
- **Balanced**: Mix of offensive and defensive play
- **Endgame**: Focus on endgame preparation and multipliers

## Advanced Techniques

### Scenario Analysis

#### Testing Different Scenarios

1. **Set Up Scenarios**: Create different position variations
2. **Compare Analysis**: Compare strategic evaluation of each scenario
3. **Choose Best Path**: Select the scenario with best strategic outcome
4. **Plan Execution**: Plan how to achieve the chosen scenario

#### Risk Management

1. **Identify Risks**: Use strategic analysis to identify potential risks
2. **Evaluate Impact**: Assess the impact of different risks
3. **Plan Mitigation**: Develop plans to mitigate identified risks
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track how well risk mitigation is working

### Long-term Planning

#### Endgame Preparation

1. **Early Planning**: Start endgame preparation early
2. **Wall Completion**: Plan for wall completion bonuses
3. **Color Sets**: Plan for color set completion
4. **Floor Line**: Plan strategic floor line usage

#### Multiplier Setup

1. **Identify Opportunities**: Find opportunities for multiple bonuses
2. **Plan Sequences**: Plan move sequences to achieve multipliers
3. **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Consider trade-offs between different bonuses
4. **Execute Plans**: Execute planned sequences when opportunities arise

## Best Practices

### Analysis Frequency

- **Key Positions**: Analyze every critical position
- **Regular Check-ins**: Periodic strategic analysis during games
- **Post-game Review**: Strategic analysis of completed games

### Decision Making

- **Use Multiple Tools**: Combine strategic analysis with pattern detection
- **Consider Context**: Factor in opponent tendencies and game situation
- **Plan Flexibility**: Have backup plans for when primary plans fail
- **Learn from Results**: Review how strategic plans worked out

### Continuous Improvement

- **Track Performance**: Monitor how well strategic plans work
- **Learn Patterns**: Identify successful strategic patterns
- **Adjust Approach**: Modify strategic approach based on results
- **Practice Regularly**: Regular practice with strategic analysis tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Analysis Takes Too Long

**Problem**: Strategic analysis is very slow
**Solutions**:
- Use "Quick Analysis" for faster results
- Reduce analysis depth for complex positions
- Check system resources and close other applications

#### Results Are Unclear

**Problem**: Strategic recommendations are confusing
**Solutions**:
- Focus on position strength scores first
- Review risk assessments for clarity
- Use scenario analysis to compare options

#### Recommendations Seem Wrong

**Problem**: Strategic recommendations don't match your analysis
**Solutions**:
- Check position setup for accuracy
- Review analysis parameters
- Compare with pattern detection results
- Consider using multiple analysis tools
