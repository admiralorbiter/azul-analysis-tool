### Session Details

Each training session includes:

- **Configuration**: Complete training parameters
- **Progress**: Training progress and duration
- **Results**: Final model performance metrics
- **Logs**: Detailed training logs and errors

## Configuration Management

### Saved Configurations

#### Creating Templates

1. **Configure Parameters**: Set up your desired training configuration
2. **Save Template**: Click "Save Configuration" with a descriptive name
3. **Reuse**: Load saved configurations for consistent training

#### Managing Templates

- **Edit Configurations**: Modify saved training templates
- **Delete Templates**: Remove unused configurations
- **Share Configurations**: Export/import configuration files

### Configuration Best Practices

#### For Beginners

- **Start Small**: Use small model size for initial experiments
- **CPU Training**: Begin with CPU to avoid GPU setup issues
- **Few Epochs**: Start with 10-50 epochs to test setup
- **Small Samples**: Use 100-500 samples for quick testing

#### For Advanced Users

- **GPU Training**: Use CUDA for faster training on large datasets
- **Large Models**: Use large model size for best accuracy
- **Many Epochs**: Train for 200+ epochs for convergence
- **Large Datasets**: Use 5000+ samples for robust training

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Training Won't Start

**Problem**: "ðŸš€ Start Training" button doesn't respond
**Solutions**:
- Check PyTorch installation: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"`
- Verify database connection
- Check console for error messages

#### Slow Training

**Problem**: Training is very slow
**Solutions**:
- Switch to GPU if available
- Reduce model size or batch size
- Check CPU/memory usage in monitor

#### Training Fails

**Problem**: Training session fails with errors
**Solutions**:
- Check training logs in session details
- Reduce batch size or learning rate
- Verify sufficient disk space for model files

#### Memory Issues

**Problem**: Out of memory errors
**Solutions**:
- Reduce batch size
- Use smaller model size
- Switch to CPU training
- Close other applications

### Performance Optimization

#### For Faster Training

1. **Use GPU**: Switch to CUDA device if available
2. **Increase Batch Size**: Larger batches train faster (if memory allows)
3. **Reduce Model Size**: Smaller models train faster
4. **Optimize Data**: Use efficient data loading

#### For Better Accuracy

1. **Use Large Model**: Larger models generally achieve better accuracy
2. **Train Longer**: More epochs often improve performance
3. **More Data**: Increase samples per epoch
4. **Fine-tune Learning Rate**: Experiment with different learning rates
