# üéØ Move Quality Assessment - User Guide

> **Understanding and using the comprehensive move quality evaluation system**

## üìã **Overview**

The Move Quality Assessment System evaluates every possible move in your position and ranks them from brilliant (!!) to poor (?). This helps you understand not just what moves are good, but **why** they're good and how they compare to alternatives.

## üéØ **Quality Tiers Explained**

### **!! (Brilliant Move) - 90-100 points**
**What it means**: Exceptional moves that achieve multiple high-value objectives simultaneously.

**Characteristics**:
- Creates significant strategic advantage with minimal risk
- Often involves complex pattern combinations
- Can be game-winning moves in critical situations

**Examples**:
- Completing a wall row/column while blocking opponent and setting up multiplier
- Critical endgame moves that secure victory
- Brilliant tactical sequences that disrupt opponent while scoring

### **! (Excellent Move) - 75-89 points**
**What it means**: Strong moves that achieve primary strategic objectives with clear benefits.

**Characteristics**:
- Good risk/reward ratio
- Solid execution of tactical patterns
- Clear strategic advantage

**Examples**:
- Efficient wall completion with bonus
- Strong blocking moves with scoring benefits
- Well-timed floor line management

### **= (Good/Solid Move) - 50-74 points**
**What it means**: Reasonable moves that don't harm your position.

**Characteristics**:
- Achieves basic objectives without major benefits
- Safe, but not particularly inspired
- Maintains position without creating problems

**Examples**:
- Standard pattern line filling
- Safe tile collection without special benefits
- Maintenance moves in neutral positions

### **?! (Dubious Move) - 25-49 points**
**What it means**: Moves with some benefit but significant downsides.

**Characteristics**:
- Creates unnecessary risk or missed opportunities
- Poor timing or execution
- Questionable strategic value

**Examples**:
- Taking tiles that overflow to floor line unnecessarily
- Missing clear blocking opportunities
- Inefficient pattern line usage

### **? (Poor Move) - 0-24 points**
**What it means**: Clear mistakes with significant negative impact.

**Characteristics**:
- Helps opponent more than player
- Violates basic strategic principles
- Creates avoidable problems

**Examples**:
- Taking tiles that directly help opponent complete patterns
- Severe floor line penalties when alternatives exist
- Moves that block own future opportunities

## üîç **How to Use Move Quality Analysis**

### **1. Understanding Your Position**
- **Check the quality tier** of your current best move
- **Review the score** (0-100) for precise evaluation
- **Read the explanation** to understand why the move is rated this way

### **2. Exploring Alternatives**
- **Compare top 3-5 moves** to see your options
- **Read trade-off analysis** to understand why one move is better
- **Consider situational factors** (e.g., "If you're behind, consider move #2")

### **3. Learning from Analysis**
- **Pattern connections**: See how moves relate to detected patterns
- **Strategic principles**: Understand the underlying strategic concepts
- **Common mistakes**: Learn what to avoid in similar situations
