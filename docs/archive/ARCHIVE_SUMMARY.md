## üéØ **Archive Rationale**

### **Why These Documents Were Archived**

1. **Completed Features**: These features are fully implemented and no longer need active documentation maintenance
2. **Historical Planning**: These planning documents contained timeline-specific references that are no longer relevant
3. **Redundant Information**: Multiple documents contained similar information that has been consolidated
4. **Priority-Based Organization**: Current development focuses on priority-based planning rather than timeline-based planning

### **What Remains Active**

- **Core Documentation**: `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `QUICK_START.md`
- **Current Planning**: `CURRENT_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PRIORITIES.md`
- **Maintenance**: `MAINTENANCE_CHECKLIST.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`
- **Technical Documentation**: Implementation guides and API documentation
- **User Guides**: Current user documentation and guides

## üìä **Archive Maintenance**

### **Archive Review Schedule**
- **Monthly**: Check for documents that can be archived
- **Quarterly**: Major archive cleanup and reorganization
- **Annually**: Comprehensive archive review and cleanup

### **Archive Criteria**
- **Completed Features**: Move to archive when feature is stable and no longer actively developed
- **Historical Planning**: Archive timeline-specific planning documents
- **Redundant Information**: Archive duplicate or superseded documents
- **Outdated References**: Archive documents with outdated technical references

### **Archive Access**
- **Reference**: Archive documents are available for historical reference
- **Research**: Archive documents can be consulted for research purposes
- **Learning**: Archive documents provide learning opportunities for new contributors

## üîÑ **Archive Management**

### **Archive Organization**
- **By Type**: Separate completed features from historical planning
- **By Date**: Organize by completion or creation date
- **By Priority**: Organize by original priority level
- **By Feature**: Group related documents together

### **Archive Maintenance**
- **Regular Review**: Monthly review of archive contents
- **Cleanup**: Quarterly cleanup of truly obsolete content
- **Consolidation**: Annual consolidation of similar documents
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear archive documentation
